# DSA CAPSTONE PROJECT

### Project Title: Amazon Product Rating and Review

### Project Overview
---
The purpose of this project is to analyze product performance based on customer ratings and reviews from an e-commerce dataset (Amazon). This analysis helps identify which products perform best, uncover customer preferences, and reveal how pricing and discount strategies influence product ratings and engagement which my team and I at **RetailTech Insights** leveraged to generate actionable insights for product improvement, marketing strategy, and customer engagement.

### Data Source
---
The Amazon case study dataset is an Excel file primarily sourced from DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project and this is an open source data which can be downloaded freely from an Open source online such as Kaggle or any other data repository site.

3. Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values


### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
1. Data cleaning
2. Data analysis
3. Visualization
- Github for portfolio building

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
My team and I performed the following actions in the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation:
- Data loading and Inspection
- Handling Missing Variables: This was handled using Substitute function, Find and Replace.
- Data cleaning and formatting: Ensure all percentages, numbers, currency values, and IDs are formatted consistently.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved the exploration of the data to answer some questions about the dataset such as:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
